## Tree Identification Tool
You can use this simple __Javascript__ function to identify a tree by its characteristics:
```
function identify tree(leaf_shape, region){
     if (leaf_shape == "needle" && region == "cold"){
          return "Pine Tree"
     } else if(leaf_shape == "broad" && region == "temperate"){
          return "Oak Tree"
     } else {
          return "Unknown Tree"
     }
}
console.log(identify_tree("needle", "cold"))
```
