# Short Response Questions

1) One person should invite others to one repository and each person should create their own branch so that everyone could work in their own space and prevent messing up someone else's work or the main branch.
2) Developers use branches to continue working and adding changes without affecting the main branch.
3) Git is a command line tool that allows you to track and manage files, github is a cloud based web service that allows developers to track, store and manage files and changes made to them. They work together to help users store their files and all their changes.
4) The order of the commands is wrong because `git add .` should be the first command, then `git commit -m "saving work"` and then `git push` to save your work.
